# Development Rules

## Repo Map

Before searching, check these maps:

- `docs/package-map.md` - packages, dependency graph, build order, and a "where is X" index
- `docs/npm-packages.md` - install/build/test mechanics, the src-vs-dist resolution split, and common traps
- `docs/ui-map.md` - tui library and interactive-mode components grouped by purpose
- `docs/bun-migration.md` - record of the completed npm -> bun migration and the post-migration rules
- `docs/agent-spec-tree-map.md` - on-disk agent-spec surfaces, their standard status, and what hoocode scans/supports

## Recent Changes

- **Release prep: every platform gets a binary, the band teaches the product,
  and the fork's name is gone.** Four threads. (1) Releases shipped one archive
  (`hoocode-windows-x64.zip`), so everyone on macOS or Linux had npm as their
  only route. `scripts/build-binaries.sh` now takes `--targets`/`--list` and
  builds seven — linux and darwin on x64/arm64, linux also on musl (which closes
  the Alpine/distroless dead end `docs/install.md` used to merely describe) —
  plus `checksums.txt`, all cross-compiled from one runner. `install/install.sh`
  (POSIX sh, because it is piped to `sh` on machines with no bash) and
  `install/install.ps1` detect the platform including musl-vs-glibc, verify the
  sha256, install under `~/.hoocode` with no root, and pre-seed the optional Rust
  helpers into `~/.hoocode/bin` — the directory `tools-manager.ts` already looks
  in. `HOOCODE_RELEASE_BASE_URL` points either at a mirror. Every `darwin-*`
  binary is ad-hoc signed before it is packed (`rcodesign` on the Linux release
  runner, `codesign` locally) because `bun build --compile` invalidates the
  Mach-O signature it inherits and macOS kills such a binary on sight rather
  than warning — never ship an unsigned one. (2)
  `interactive/tips.ts` is the single file every tip lives in, with
  `tips-controller.ts` deciding when: the band's one uninvited guest, and the
  rules that keeps honest are in `docs/ui-map.md` → "Tips are the band's one
  uninvited guest". The star nudge is deliberately not one of the tips — never
  first, once per session, three times in a lifetime. (3) The extension API
  parameter is `hoo`, not `pi`, across core extensions, examples, docs and
  tests; the OAuth callback page shows the Hoo mark. Two `pi` spellings stay on
  purpose and say why in the code: `pkg.pi` as a deprecated manifest alias
  (third-party packages still use it; `hoocode` wins when both are present), and
  the Codex `originator` header, which is a protocol value the ChatGPT backend
  validates, not branding. (4) `CONTRIBUTING.md` no longer describes a
  contribution gate that was never implemented — see "Contributions" below.
  Guarded by `coding-agent/test/tips.test.ts` and the two manifest-alias cases in
  `extensions-discovery.test.ts`.

- **The app packs against the floor, the window repaints when it has to move
  back, and a click opens a link again**: five complaints, one theme — the
  chrome getting in the way of what it frames. (1) `FlexSpacer` is now the
  *first* child of the root, so the leftover rows are above the banner and
  everything below it is one run against the bottom of the screen; the band of
  blank between the conversation and the prompt is gone at every session length.
  (2) A buffer taller than the screen that *shrinks* — a picker closing, a fold
  by the `radar` view dial — has its visible window repainted in place
  (absolutely addressed, one screenful, no clear) instead of banking the given-up
  rows as blank. (3) `full` chrome keeps the whole task ledger mid-turn; the
  `agentStreaming` input is gone from `resolveChrome` with it, because a turn is
  when the rows are worth the most and `compact` is the stop for wanting them
  back. (4) A notification may name a `topic`; two glimpses of one topic replace
  each other on screen and restart the clock, so a dial stepped twice shows the
  stop it is on rather than lagging a press behind. (5) The paper shadow is
  eighths, not halves — `▔` run, `▏` column. Plus: mouse capture took clicks
  away from OSC 8 links, so the TUI resolves them itself (`hyperlinkAt` +
  `TUI.onHyperlink` -> `utils/open-url.ts`, no shell, scheme allowlist). Rules:
  `docs/ui-map.md` -> "Filling the screen", "What ghosts and what stays",
  "Scrolling the transcript", "Screen columns"; guarded by
  `tui/test/screen-fill.test.ts`, `tui/test/hyperlink-click.test.ts`,
  `tui/test/paper-sheet.test.ts`, `coding-agent/test/screen-anchor.test.ts`,
  `notification-panel.test.ts` and `chrome-layout.test.ts`.

- **The prompt on the floor, the band that carries every receipt, and a copy
  that keeps its structure**: three fixes to the same complaint — the app coming
  apart around the prompt. (1) Once the session is taller than the screen the
  fill is 0 and the *terminal's* scroll holds the prompt down, so anything that
  made the frame shorter — a picker closing, a notification fading — stranded
  the prompt mid-screen with blanks under it. `fitFlexSpacer` now takes what the
  chrome gave up (capped at a screenful) so the buffer keeps its length and the
  blank band lands above the prompt, where the next output lands in it. (2)
  `showStatus` goes to the notification band, not the transcript: every command
  receipt, extensions' `ctx.ui.notify(…, "info")` included, listings and all,
  with a third of the screen for a body and reading time by the row. The
  exceptions are `showRecord` — a share URL, an export path, where credentials
  were saved — which still write a transcript row. The band is filled now
  (`warningBg` / `customMessageBg`, full width), so it reads at a glance. (3)
  `/copy`, `/copy all` and `/copy <turns>` copy the *markdown the model wrote*
  plus an HTML flavour (`utils/markdown-to-html.ts`, `utils/rich-clipboard.ts`),
  so a paste into Word or Confluence keeps its headings, lists and tables
  instead of arriving as box-drawing and dotted rules; Linux clipboards
  advertise one type, so they get the markdown and the status line says so.
  Rules: `docs/ui-map.md` -> "Filling the screen" and "What ghosts and what
  stays"; guarded by `tui/test/screen-fill.test.ts`,
  `coding-agent/test/screen-anchor.test.ts`, `notification-panel.test.ts` and
  `copy-structure.test.ts`.

- **The app fills the screen, and what just changed ghosts**: the renderer
  appends, so a frame used to be exactly as tall as its content — banner a few
  rows down, prompt walking down the terminal as the session grew. `FlexSpacer`
  is one child of the root that takes whatever rows the frame did not use
  (`TUI.setFlexSpacer`, fitted in `doRender`), so the banner is on the first row
  and the prompt and footer on the last at every session length, pickers
  included. Still the normal screen: scrollback, selection and search are
  untouched, and the pinned view empties the fill before it paints. Alongside
  it, `components/notification-panel.ts` is a transient band above the prompt:
  every dial step, the settings glimpses and every `showWarning` go there and
  are gone in a few seconds, while errors, `showNotice` and anything carrying a
  value you cannot reconstruct from the screen stay in the transcript. Inside
  the band a glimpse replaces and a warning queues, and neither overwrites what
  is already on screen. The chrome dial's middle stop now keeps the ledger's
  counts instead of hiding it outright — `compact` makes the same trade for the
  ledger it already made for the footer. Rules: `docs/ui-map.md` -> "Filling the
  screen" and "What ghosts and what stays"; guarded by
  `tui/test/screen-fill.test.ts`, `coding-agent/test/screen-anchor.test.ts`,
  `coding-agent/test/notification-panel.test.ts` and `chrome-layout.test.ts`.

- **Chrome density and transcript navigation**: one dial (`alt+z`, the seventh)
  sets how much of the screen the chrome below the transcript gets — full /
  compact / bare — and `interactive/chrome-layout.ts` holds the whole policy in
  one pure function (`resolveChrome`). The footer lends its rows to an open
  completion list; the task ledger keeps its counts and drops its rows mid-turn;
  a terminal under 25 rows opens compact. `Slot` is the mechanism: a hidden slot
  returns one *frozen* array and does not render its child, because the render
  caches compare by array identity and a fresh `[]` reads as a change every
  frame. The prompt has no slot on purpose. Transcript navigation gained search
  (`ctrl+r`, `/` when pinned, `n`/`p` to step), turn jumps (`ctrl+up`/`ctrl+down`,
  stopping on your own messages), `/copy` on a key, and a real editor redo.
  Rules: `docs/ui-map.md` -> "Scrolling the transcript"; guarded by
  `chrome-layout.test.ts`, `scroll-viewport.test.ts` and `scroll-view-keys.test.ts`.

- **Transcript scrolling is the app's, not the terminal's**: scrolling back
  used to mean scrolling the terminal's scrollback, and every full redraw
  (`\x1b[3J`) threw that away — so the view jumped to the bottom whenever a row
  above the viewport changed. `TUI.scrollOffset` now pins a window over the line
  buffer and paints it on the **alternate screen**; live mode, the normal
  screen and the terminal's own scrollback/selection/search are untouched, and
  leaving is a differential frame, never a replay. The mouse wheel is captured
  (`tui/src/mouse.ts`, `?1000h` + `?1006h`; `HOOCODE_MOUSE=0` opts out, and
  shift still bypasses for native selection). Keys: `app.scroll.*` — pageUp /
  pageDown / ctrl+home / ctrl+end at the prompt, arrows and escape once pinned;
  `tui.editor.pageUp`/`pageDown` ship unbound, having had a one-to-three-line
  prompt to page through. Rules: `docs/ui-map.md` -> "Scrolling the
  transcript"; guarded by `tui/test/scroll-viewport.test.ts`,
  `tui/test/mouse.test.ts` and `coding-agent/test/scroll-view-keys.test.ts`.

- **One frame for every user input**: every surface that asks the user for
  something — the pickers, the `ask_options` pane, the extension selector /
  input / editor, the login dialog — replaces the prompt editor, so it draws the
  prompt's frame. `InputFrame`
  (`interactive/components/input-frame.ts`) wraps the tui `Frame`, whose edges
  come out of `renderFrameEdge` — the same function `Editor` draws its border
  with. It follows the `editorBorder` setting, names itself in the top border
  (never a title row inside), keeps the hints as the last row inside, and insets
  content one column. Never add a second way to draw a border around an input.
  Rules: `docs/ui-map.md` -> "One frame for every user input"; guarded by
  `coding-agent/test/input-surface-frame.test.ts` and `tui/test/frame.test.ts`.
- **TUI screen columns**: a widget fills the width it was handed — no margin
  held back "for safety". `SelectList` and `SettingsList` each gave two columns
  of every row away; `PAPER_INSET` is 1, not 3, because the shadow's `▌` is a
  left half-block and so *is* the gutter. Rules and the tests that hold them:
  `docs/ui-map.md` -> "Screen columns".

- **Keybinding families**: the map is grouped by intention, not mechanism —
  Compose, Steer, Read, Go, Flow, plus overlays that print their own keys. Five
  learned groups, none over five subjects, because that is what a person holds.
  Declaration order in `core/keybindings.ts` *is* the grouping and is also what
  `keybindings.json` is written in; the banner, `/hotkeys` and
  `docs/keybindings.md` follow the same order. The layout test enforces all of it.
- **Keybinding dials**: the six on-screen ordered-set controls are all
  `alt+<letter>` forward and `shift+alt+<letter>` back, the letter naming the
  dial — **a**gent mode, **m**odel, **t**hinking, tool **o**utput, task
  **l**edger, session **c**olour. Nothing else steps a dial and no dial is
  anywhere else. `ctrl+o` and `ctrl+t` pair by letter with their dials and act
  on what is drawn right now. `test/keybinding-layout.test.ts` holds the rule;
  a new dial goes in its `DIALS` list.
- **Keybinding rings**: `ctrl` is the view, `alt` is the cockpit, `shift`
  reverses, and inside a picker every `ctrl` key belongs to the query line —
  so a picker's verbs are all on `alt`. A bare `shift+<letter>` is banned
  outright: a legacy terminal sends it as the plain uppercase letter, which no
  scope with a query line can tell from typing. Every id must appear in a scope
  in `test/keybinding-layout.test.ts`; defaults and the ring story live in
  `core/keybindings.ts` and `docs/keybindings.md`.
- **One surface for startup, `/new` and `/reload`**: all three repaint from the
  same list in `interactive-mode.ts` (`applyRuntimeSettings` ->
  `applySessionTheme` -> `finishRuntimeSettings`) and draw the resource listing
  exactly once. Never add a settings-to-chrome line to one path only. Rules and
  the reason each step sits where it does: `docs/ui-map.md` -> "One surface for
  startup, a session swap, and `/reload`". `test/suite/session-surface-sync.test.ts`
  drives every chain of the two commands through a real mode against a capturing
  terminal and compares rendered frames.
- **TUI vertical rhythm**: one blank line separates two blocks, and it is
  never paid for twice. A block's separator is the `Spacer(1)` before it (so
  the block itself takes `paddingY: 0`), a `DynamicBorder` needs no blank
  beside it, and nothing pads its own bottom edge. Rules and reference cases:
  `docs/ui-map.md` -> "Vertical rhythm".
- **`grep`/`find`/`ls` tools removed**: `SearchCodebase` is the only dedicated
  code-discovery tool; exact matching lines, counts, and raw directory listings
  are a shell job through `bash`. Claude Code's `Grep`/`Glob`/`Find` all
  normalize to `SearchCodebase`; `LS` has no counterpart and is dropped with a
  diagnostic. `TOOL_FACTORIES` is 7 built-ins.
- **`search` renamed to `SearchCodebase`**: a clean break, no alias. The old
  name resolves nowhere and is dropped from an allowlist with a diagnostic. It
  pairs with the `SearchHooCode` extension tool, and it is the one built-in
  that is not lowercase.
- **Browser + document tools removed**: `browser_*`, `Doc*`, `filetools-shared.ts`, and their `--enable-browsertools`/`--enable-browser-live-preview`/`--enable-filetools` flags are gone; `TOOL_FACTORIES` shrank accordingly.
- **Providers removed**: `amazon-bedrock`, `mistral`, `cloudflare-workers-ai`, `cloudflare-ai-gateway`. `mistralai/*` ids via OpenRouter still work.
- **MCP Standard Config Support**: Now reads standard `mcp.json` format from:
  - `~/.agents/mcp.json` (user-level)
  - `.agents/mcp.json` (project-level)
  - `~/.config/claude/mcp.json` (Claude Desktop)
  - Existing per-server JSON files in `mcp-servers/` still work as fallback
  - First-wins deduplication across all sources

## Prompt token surface

Everything in the system prompt and in an active tool's schema is re-sent on
**every** request. Measure before and after any change to either:

```bash
hoocode --print-token-surface   # src/main.ts -> measurePromptSurface (core/light.ts)
```

It reports the assembled system prompt plus each active tool's serialized
`{name, description, parameters}`, estimated at chars/4. Treat it as a floor:
providers add their own envelope, and schema JSON tokenizes worse than prose.

Current baseline, measured with the default tool set and no context files:
**~6,690 tokens** — ~3,660 system prompt, ~3,040 tool schemas. Adding this
repo's `AGENTS.md` as a context file costs another ~4,740, which makes it the
single largest line item by a wide margin.

Re-measure rather than trusting that number: it is a snapshot, and every tool
added since it was last written moved it. Run the command above in an empty
directory for the clean figure, and in the repo root for the with-context one.

**A tool's guidance belongs in exactly one place.** A tool contributes text
through four channels, and it is easy to pay for the same sentence twice:

| Channel | Ships in | Use it for |
|---|---|---|
| `description` | tool schema | what the tool does, its contract, its limits |
| `parameters` descriptions | tool schema | per-argument semantics |
| `promptSnippet` | system prompt, `Available tools:` | one line, for picking between tools |
| `promptGuidelines` | system prompt, `Guidelines:` | behavior the schema cannot express |

Rules that follow from that:

- **Never restate a parameter's semantics in `promptGuidelines`.** Both ship on
  every turn. `edit` carried five guidelines, four of which repeated its own
  `oldText`/`edits`/`replaceAll` descriptions verbatim.
- **Never restate a cross-tool routing rule in a tool.** `buildSystemPrompt`
  already emits the canonical search-vs-bash and file-exploration guidelines
  whenever the relevant tools are registered. `SearchCodebase`, `read`, and `bash` each
  carried their own copy; that rule was shipping three times.
- **Don't spell out what the schema already encodes.** An enum of `f`/`d`/`l`
  does not need prose naming all three.
- **Examples are the most expensive thing in a schema.** One is usually enough;
  the retired `find` tool's `pattern` had three and was the priciest built-in
  schema in the repo.
- Keep per-tool `promptGuidelines` under ~200 chars, and prefer adding to a
  tool's `description` over adding a guideline — descriptions at least stay next
  to the contract they describe.

When adding a tool, budget it: a built-in should land under ~250 tokens
serialized. Anything materially above that needs a reason, and the
when-to-use guidance probably belongs in a system-prompt block instead — that
is why `Task` keeps its mechanics in `description` and its when-to-delegate
guidance (~1.6KB) in `buildTaskMainPrompt`.

## Where a capability belongs

Before writing a capability as code, decide which of the four homes it wants.
The mistake this rule exists to prevent is shipping prose as TypeScript: a
prompt compiled into a string constant is not type-checked, not editable as
prose, and often resident on every turn.

| Home | Always-on cost | Body loaded | Isolation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Tool | full schema, every turn | never (always resident) | no |
| Agent | summarized `description` in `<available_agents>` | on dispatch | **yes** — own context, enforced tool allowlist, own model tier |
| Skill | `<name>` + `<description>` + `<location>` | on `read` | no |
| Slash command | **nothing** | on invocation | no |

The rule that follows:

> **Agent when you need isolation. Skill when you need instruction. Command
> when a human triggers it. Tool only when the model must call it with
> structured arguments.**

Skills and agents cost about the same per turn, so "convert an agent to a skill"
never saves tokens — pick between them on isolation, not price. A subagent is a
whole extra model context that cannot see the parent conversation; a skill is a
`read` into the context you already have.

Two corollaries:

- **Prose lives in a file, not a string constant.** `templates/prompts/*.md`
  and `templates/modes/*/system.md` are embedded at build time by
  `scripts/embed-templates.mjs`. A prompt with no interpolation and no
  branching belongs there, and so does one with a single substitution slot — use
  a `{{TOKEN}}` placeholder (`{{PLAN_PATH}}`, `{{BACKGROUND_GUIDANCE}}`) and
  keep the variant text in its own file. Only prompts that need real logic stay
  in the module that builds them. Keeping a second hand-written copy in `.ts` is
  how the mode prompts silently diverged from the ones `/init` scaffolds.
- **Craft guidance is not a tool contract.** A tool's `promptGuidelines` are
  resident on every turn; a how-to-do-this-well guide is not a contract and
  does not belong there. Ship it as a built-in skill — add the directory under
  `templates/skills/` and an entry to `BUILTIN_SKILLS` in
  `core/builtin-skills.ts` — and point the tool at it in one line. Give it a
  `gate` unless it is useful in every session: a skill costs its description
  every turn, so one that only makes sense alongside a feature rides that
  feature's switch.

## Conversational Style

- Keep answers short and concise
- No emojis in commits, issues, PR comments, or code
- No fluff or cheerful filler text
- Technical prose only, be kind but direct (e.g., "Thanks @user" not "Thanks so much @user!")

## Code Quality

- Read files in full before making wide-ranging changes, before editing files you have not already fully inspected, and when the user asks you to investigate or audit something. Do not rely only on search snippets for broad changes.
- No `any` types unless absolutely necessary
- Check node_modules for external API type definitions instead of guessing
- **NEVER use inline imports** - no `await import("./foo.js")`, no `import("pkg").Type` in type positions, no dynamic imports for types. Always use standard top-level imports.
- NEVER remove or downgrade code to fix type errors from outdated dependencies; upgrade the dependency instead
- Always ask before removing functionality or code that appears to be intentional
- Do not preserve backward compatibility unless the user explicitly asks for it
- Never hardcode key checks with, eg. `matchesKey(keyData, "ctrl+x")`. All keybindings must be configurable. Add default to matching object (`DEFAULT_EDITOR_KEYBINDINGS` or `DEFAULT_APP_KEYBINDINGS`)
- NEVER modify `packages/ai/src/models.generated.ts` directly. Update `packages/ai/scripts/generate-models.ts` instead.

## Commands

- After code changes (not documentation changes): `bun run check` (get full output, no tail). Fix all errors, warnings, and infos before committing.
- Note: `bun run check` does not run tests.
- NEVER run: `bun run dev`, `bun run build`, `bun test`
- Package manager: bun is the toolchain (`packageManager: bun@1.3.13`). `bun.lock`
  is the single authoritative lockfile. `bunfig.toml` pins `linker = "hoisted"`,
  so plain `bun install` yields an npm-compatible flat tree; never use bun's
  isolated linker. After any `bun install`, run `bun run check`; recover a broken
  tree with `bun install`. npm is used only for `npm publish` during releases.
  See `docs/bun-migration.md` for the completed migration.
- Only run specific tests if user instructs: `npx tsx ../../node_modules/vitest/dist/cli.js --run test/specific.test.ts`
- Run tests from the package root, not the repo root.
- If you create or modify a test file, you MUST run it and iterate on the test or the implementation until it passes.
- For `packages/coding-agent/test/suite/`, use `test/suite/harness.ts` plus the faux provider. Do not use real provider APIs, real API keys, or paid tokens.
- Put issue-specific regressions under `packages/coding-agent/test/suite/regressions/` and name them `<issue-number>-<short-slug>.test.ts`.
- NEVER commit unless user asks

## Contributions

There is no contribution gate. This section previously described one —
`issue-gate.yml`, `pr-gate.yml`, `approve-contributor.yml`, `lgtm`/`lgtmi`
approval comments — inherited from upstream along with `CONTRIBUTING.md`. None
of those workflows have ever existed in this repository, so the policy was
documentation of a thing that did not run, and `CONTRIBUTING.md` now says the
opposite. Do not reintroduce any of it without being asked.

What actually happens:

- Anyone may open an issue or a PR. Nothing is auto-closed.
- Questions are welcome as issues; `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/question.yml` exists
  for them.
- `.github/workflows/welcome.yml` replies to someone's first issue or PR. It is
  the only automation touching contributions.
- The contributor-facing rules live in `CONTRIBUTING.md`. If you change what is
  expected of a contributor, change it there, and check this section still
  agrees.

When creating issues:

- Add `pkg:*` labels to indicate which package(s) the issue affects
  - Available labels: `pkg:agent`, `pkg:ai`, `pkg:coding-agent`, `pkg:tui`
- If an issue spans multiple packages, add all relevant labels

When posting issue/PR comments:

- Write the full comment to a temp file and use `gh issue comment --body-file` or `gh pr comment --body-file`
- Never pass multi-line markdown directly via `--body` in shell commands
- Preview the exact comment text before posting
- Post exactly one final comment unless the user explicitly asks for multiple comments
- If a comment is malformed, delete it immediately, then post one corrected comment
- Keep comments concise, technical, and in the user's tone

When closing issues via commit:

- Include `fixes #<number>` or `closes #<number>` in the commit message
- This automatically closes the issue when the commit is merged

## PR Workflow

- Analyze PRs without pulling locally first
- If the user approves: create a feature branch, pull PR, rebase on main, apply adjustments, commit, merge into main, push, close PR, and leave a comment in the user's tone
- You never open PRs yourself. We work in feature branches until everything is according to the user's requirements, then merge into main, and push.

### Slash commands

- `/pr [patch|minor|major]` - opens a PR on a feature branch. With a bump it labels the PR `npm:<bump>` so the merge-release workflow publishes on merge; without one it only opens a PR (no publish). Defined in `.agents/commands/pr.md`.
- `/postmerge [pr-number]` - after a PR merges, verifies CI, npm publish, version bump, tag and GitHub release, then returns to an up-to-date `main`. Defined in `.agents/commands/postmerge.md`.
- Slash-command definitions live in `.agents/commands/` (also read from `.hoocode/commands/`, `.claude/commands/`, and the user-level equivalents). Scaffold a new one with `/new-command <name>`.

## Testing hoocode Interactive Mode with tmux

To test hoocode's TUI in a controlled terminal environment:

```bash
# Create tmux session with specific dimensions
tmux new-session -d -s hoocode-test -x 80 -y 24

# Start hoocode from source
tmux send-keys -t hoocode-test "cd <repo-root> && ./hoocode-test.sh" Enter

# Wait for startup, then capture output
sleep 3 && tmux capture-pane -t hoocode-test -p

# Send input
tmux send-keys -t hoocode-test "your prompt here" Enter

# Send special keys
tmux send-keys -t hoocode-test Escape
tmux send-keys -t hoocode-test C-o  # ctrl+o

# Cleanup
tmux kill-session -t hoocode-test
```

## Adding a New LLM Provider (packages/ai)

Adding a new provider requires changes across multiple files:

### 1. Core Types (`packages/ai/src/types.ts`)

- Add API identifier to `Api` type union (e.g., `"bedrock-converse-stream"`)
- Create options interface extending `StreamOptions`
- Add mapping to `ApiOptionsMap`
- Add provider name to `KnownProvider` type union

### 2. Provider Implementation (`packages/ai/src/providers/`)

Create provider file exporting:

- `stream<Provider>()` function returning `AssistantMessageEventStream`
- `streamSimple<Provider>()` for `SimpleStreamOptions` mapping
- Provider-specific options interface
- Message/tool conversion functions
- Response parsing emitting standardized events (`text`, `tool_call`, `thinking`, `usage`, `stop`)

### 3. Provider Exports and Lazy Registration

- Add a package subpath export in `packages/ai/package.json` pointing at `./dist/providers/<provider>.js`
- Add `export type` re-exports in `packages/ai/src/index.ts` for provider option types that should remain available from the root entry
- Register the provider in `packages/ai/src/providers/register-builtins.ts` via lazy loader wrappers, do not statically import provider implementation modules there
- Add credential detection in `packages/ai/src/env-api-keys.ts`

### 4. Model Generation (`packages/ai/scripts/generate-models.ts`)

- Add logic to fetch/parse models from provider source
- Map to standardized `Model` interface

### 5. Tests (`packages/ai/test/`)

- Always add the provider to `stream.test.ts` with at least one representative model, even if it reuses an existing API implementation such as `openai-completions`.
- Add the provider to the broader provider matrix where applicable: `tokens.test.ts`, `abort.test.ts`, `empty.test.ts`, `context-overflow.test.ts`, `unicode-surrogate.test.ts`, `tool-call-without-result.test.ts`, `image-tool-result.test.ts`, `total-tokens.test.ts`, `cross-provider-handoff.test.ts`.
- For `cross-provider-handoff.test.ts`, add at least one provider/model pair. If the provider exposes multiple model families (for example GPT and Claude), add at least one pair per family.
- For non-standard auth, create utility (e.g., `bedrock-utils.ts`) with credential detection.

### 6. Coding Agent (`packages/coding-agent/`)

- `src/core/model-resolver.ts`: Add default model ID to `defaultModelPerProvider`
- `src/core/provider-display-names.ts`: Add API-key login display name so `/login` and related UI show the provider for built-in API-key auth.
- `src/cli/args.ts`: Add env var documentation
- `README.md`: Add provider setup instructions
- `docs/providers.md`: Add setup instructions, env var, and `auth.json` key

### 7. Documentation

- `packages/ai/README.md`: Add to providers table, document options/auth, add env vars
- `packages/ai/CHANGELOG.md`: Add entry under `## [Unreleased]`

## Releasing

**Lockstep versioning**: All packages always share the same version number. Every release updates all packages together.

**Version semantics** (no major releases):

- `patch`: Bug fixes and new features
- `minor`: API breaking changes

### Steps

1. **Update CHANGELOGs**: Ensure all changes since last release are documented in the `[Unreleased]` section of each affected package's CHANGELOG.md

2. **Run release script**:
   ```bash
   npm run release:patch    # Fixes and additions
   npm run release:minor    # API breaking changes
   ```

The script handles: version bump, CHANGELOG finalization, commit, tag, publish, and adding new `[Unreleased]` sections.

## Git Rules for Parallel Agents

Other agents may have uncommitted work in this worktree.

- Stage only the paths you created/modified/deleted this session; run `git status` first and verify. Never `git add -A` or `git add .`.
- `packages/ai/src/models.generated.ts` may always be staged alongside your files.
- Include `fixes #<number>` / `closes #<number>` in the commit message when there is a related issue or PR.
- Never run: force push, `git reset --hard`, `git checkout .`, `git clean -fd`, `git stash`, `git commit --no-verify`.
- Update with `git pull --rebase`; resolve conflicts only in your own files, and abort and ask if a conflict is in a file you did not touch.
- If user instructions conflict with these rules, ask for confirmation before overriding them.
