/**
 * Tips, and the one place they are written down.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * HooCode has four modes, ~40 slash commands, a rebindable key for most dials,
 * skills, plugins, canvases and a subagent runner. None of that is discoverable
 * by using the product: the prompt looks like a prompt, so people find `/help`,
 * find three things, and use those three things forever. The features that
 * would have saved them the most time are exactly the ones they never learn
 * exist.
 *
 * The fix is not a longer help page — it is putting one small thing in front of
 * someone at a moment when they are not busy. There are two such moments in a
 * session and the band above the prompt already owns both of them:
 *
 *   - **idle**: the prompt is up, nothing is streaming, and the user has not
 *     touched a key in a while. They are reading, or thinking, or away.
 *   - **streaming**: the agent has been working for long enough that the user is
 *     watching a spinner. That time is already spent; spending it on one line
 *     costs nothing.
 *
 * ## The rules a tip obeys
 *
 * A tip is the lowest-priority thing on the screen, and the rules below all come
 * from that one fact:
 *
 *   - It never interrupts. `TipsController` posts only when the band is empty,
 *     so a tip can never push aside, delay, or replace something the user
 *     actually caused.
 *   - It never repeats until everything else has been said. The rotation walks
 *     unseen tips first and remembers across sessions, so a returning user does
 *     not get taught `alt+a` five times.
 *   - It is short. Headline plus at most two rows, the same budget any glimpse
 *     gets, because it fades on the same clock.
 *   - It can be turned off, in one place, forever (`/settings`, or
 *     `tips.enabled: false`).
 *
 * ## Keys are resolved late
 *
 * A tip that names a key reads it out of the live keybinding manager at display
 * time rather than baking a string in here. Someone who rebound the mode dial
 * should be taught *their* key, and a tip that teaches the wrong one is worse
 * than no tip.
 *
 * ## Adding a tip
 *
 * Add a row to {@link TIPS}. Give it an id that will never be reused (the id is
 * what "already seen" is stored against, so renaming one re-teaches it to
 * everybody). Keep the headline under ~50 columns so it survives a narrow
 * terminal, and put anything longer in `body`.
