/**
 * Regression test for https://github.com/kolisachint/hoocode-ts/issues/3303
 *
 * File discovery previously collected every `.gitignore` under the search path
 * and passed them to `fd` via `--ignore-file`. fd treats `--ignore-file`
 * entries as a single global ignore source, so rules from `a/.gitignore` also
 * filtered files under sibling `b/`. The fix was hierarchical `.gitignore`
 * handling, scoping each file to its own subtree.
 *
 * The `find` tool that first hit this is gone; `collectEntries` — which now
 * walks the tree for `SearchCodebase`'s lexical retriever and the embsearch repo scan —
 * inherits the guarantee, so the regression is pinned here.
